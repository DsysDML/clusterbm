## Installation

- Include the main directory to your PATH environment variable by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
```
RBM_CLUSTERING=/path/to/RBM-hierarchical-clustering
```

- Create some repositories for storing the data and the programs' outputs
```
mkdir data models trees
```

## Usage
#### Data source format

## TreeRBM
Once you have a trained model in the folder `models/`, you can use the `rbm-maketree` command to generate the hierarchical tree for a dataset compatible with the one used for the training of the RBM. Use `rbm-maketree -h` to list all the optional arguments.

The script will output a repository in the `trees/` folder with a name referring to the model used for generating the tree. Inside the repository, there will be a file `tree.json` containing the information about the TreeRBM object created and (optionally) a `node_features.h5` file containing the features at each node of the tree.

To generate a newick file of the tree and the corresponding iTOL annotation files, the TreeRBM method `generate_tree` has to be called with a proper list of arguments. See the example notebook for the usage.
