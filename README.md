Code for the paper "Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the learning dynamics of RBMs" by Aur√©lien Decelle, Lorenzo Rosset and Beatriz Seoane.

ClusteRBM generates a relational tree of some input dataset using a previously trained RBM model.

## Installation

- Include the main directory to your PATH environment variable by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
```
CLUSTERBM=/path/to/clusteRBM
```

- (Optional) Create some repositories for storing the data and the programs' outputs
```
mkdir data models trees
```

## Usage

The code for training an RBM and saving the model in the correct format can be found in [TorchRBM](https://github.com/AurelienDecelle/TorchRBM.git). To obtain a proper tree reconstruction, it is important to save the parameters of the model many times during the training at evenly spaced time intervals. We therefore suggest to set `--n_save` $\geq$ 100 and `--spacing linear`.

Once you have a properly trained RBM model, to generate the tree enter:
```bash
./clusterbm -m <path_to_rbm_model> -d <path_to_data> -a <path_to_annotations> -o <output_folder>
```
This will create a folder called `output_folder` containing the tree in newick format and the annotation files to be given to [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/).

The list of available arguments can be printed using:
```bash
./clusterbm -h
```

### Mandatory arguments

- `--model, -m`: Path to the RBM model;
- `--output, -o`: Name of the repository where to save the output. If not already existent, it will be created;
- `--data, -d`: Path to the data file (fasta for categorical variables and plain text for binary variables (0, 1));
- `--annotations, -a`: Path to the `csv` file containing the data annotations. See [Annotation Format](#annotations-format) for the details;

### Optional arguments

- `--colors, -c`: Path to the `csv` file containing the label-color mapping. See [Color mapping format](#color-mapping-format) for the details;
- `--n_data`: Number of data to include in the tree. By default, the program takes the first 500 data encountered in the data file.
- `--save_node_features`: If this flag is specified, all the fixed points corresponding to the tree nodes will be saved into a `.h5` file;
- `--max_depth`: Maximum depth of the returned tree. The algorithms will use all the ages allowed by `max_age` regardless of this parameter. By default, the full tree is returned;
- `--batch_size`: Defaults to 500. Size of the batches, to be changed based on memory constraints;
- `--max_age`: Maximum age (in terms of epochs) to be considered for the tree construction. All the older models will not be used. By default it uses all the ages present in the model file;
- `--order_mf`: Order of the mean field approximation to be used for estimating the model's free energy, where '1' corresponds to the naive mean field and '2' corresponds to the TAP approximation. Binary variables support (1, 2, 3), while for categorical variables only (1, 2) are implemented. Defaults to '2';
- `--colormap`: If `colors` is omitted, the colors in the tree are assigned automatically according the Matplotlib's colomap specified here. Defaults to "tab20";
- `--max_iter`: Maximum number of iterations of the mean-field equations. Defaults to 10000;
- `--alphabet`: When the input data come from a file in fasta format, an alphabet for the symbols encoding is needed. You can choose among the default alphabets "protein", "dna", "rna", or a coherent alphabet of your choice. Defaults to "protein";
- `--alpha`: Convergence threshold for the mean-field equations. Defaults to 1e-4;
- `--eps`: Epsilon parameter of the DBSCAN algorithm.

## Annotations format
Annotations must be contained in a `csv` file. The file must have a mandatory column called "Name" and one or more columns having arbitrary names. We refer to these columns as "Legends". Each row must contain a name for the annotated data and one category for each Legend. If there is more than one Legend but you don't have annotations for all of them for a given data, just put '-1' where the information is missing. Data that do not have any annotation must not be included in this file.

When data come from a plain text file, meaning that they have no name associated, an integer number will be used for the name and it will refer to the data point of the data file at the same position of the annotation in the list.

This is an example of an annotation file:

| Name | Legend 1 | Legend 2 |
|------|----------|----------|
|name_1| label_1  | sublabel_1 |
|name_2| label_2  | -1         |
|name_3| label_3  | sublabel_3 |

**NOTE**: Legend names can't contain any special characters.

## Color mapping format
For custom coloring, a `csv` file that associates each label with a color must be provided. The file must have three columns with the mandatory names: "Legend", "Label" and "Color". Each row must have the specification of the Legend from which the label comes (it has to correspond to one of the annotation file's column names), the label and the color in hex format.

An example of color specification is the following:

| Legend | Label | Color |
|------|----------|----------|
|Legend 1| label_1  | #a6cee3 |
|Legend 1| label_2  | #1f78b4 |
|Legend 2| sublabel_3  | #b2df8a |
